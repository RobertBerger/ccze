.SH NAME
ccze \- A robust log colorizer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ccze
.RI [ options "] <" logfile
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B ccze
utility, which is a drop-in replacement for
.BR colorize ,
but written in C, to be faster and less resource-hungry. The goal was
to be fully backwards compatible, yet superior with respect to speed
and features.
.SH OPTIONS
These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
options starting with two dashes (`-'). A summary of options is
included below.
.TP
.B \-C, \-\-convert\-date
Convert unix timestamp to readable date format (in
oops and squid logs, for example).
.TP
.B \-F, \-\-rcfile \fIrcfile\fB
Read \fIrcfile\fR as a configuration file upon startup, instead of the
default ones.
.TP
.B \-o, \-\-options \fIOPTIONS...\fB
\fBCCZE\fR is able to toggle some of its features with this
option. You can toggle the \fIscroll\fR, \fIwordcolor\fR, and
\fIlookups\fR features. All of these are enabled by default. One can
turn them off by prefixing the option with a "no".

With \fIscroll\fR, one can enable or disable scrolling. If the output
is not redirected, it is wise to leave it enabled.

The \fIwordcolor\fR option makes \fBccze\fR search for different
keywords in unparsed input, and color those too. Since it is quite
fast, and makes the output look better, it is recommended to leave
this enabled.

However, \fIlookups\fR is an option that might be better to
disable. When on, \fBccze\fR will try to look up usernames, service
names, and lots of other stuff, which will slow down coloring a great
deal. If one is piping a long log through \fBccze\fR, this option
might be turned off to speed up the process.
.TP
.B \-p, \-\-plugin \fIPLUGIN\fR
While the default action is to load all plugins (see the \fBPlugins\fR
section below), when this option is present, only the specified
plugins will be loaded. If one knows what kind of log will be piped
through \fBccze\fR, using this option may result in a slight speedup.
.TP
.B \-r, \-\-remove\-facilty
Syslog\-ng puts the facility level before log messages. With this
switch, these can be cut off.
.TP
.B \-\-help
Show summary of options and exit.
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version
Show version of program.
.SH PLUGINS
Different programs have different kind of logs, and every kind of log
\fBccze\fR supports is implemented via a plug\-in. They are by default
located under \fI@pkglibdir@\fR and \fI$HOME/.ccze\fR (so they can
be overridden by the user easily).

At the moment, the following modules are bundled with the official
release:
.TP
.IR exim.so
For coloring exim's \fImain.log\fR. (See \fIexim\fR(8))
.TP
.IR httpd.so
For coloring apache-style \fIaccess.log\fR and \fIerror.log\fR
files. (See \fIapache\fR(8))
.TP
.IR procmail.so
For coloring procmail's log file. (See \fIprocmail\fR(1))
.TP
.IR squid.so
For coloring squid's \fIaccess.log\fR, \fIstore.log\fR and
\fIcache.log\fR files. (See \fIsquid\fR(8))
.TP
.IR sulog.so
For coloring \fIsulog\fR files. (See \fIsu\fR(1))
.TP
.IR super.so
For coloring \fIsuper.log\fR files. (See \fIsuper\fR(1))
.TP
.IR syslog.so
For coloring generic syslog messages. (See \fIsyslogd\fR(8))
.TP
.IR vsftpd.so
For coloring \fIvsftpd.log\fR files. (See \fIvsftpd\fR(8))
.SH FILES
.TP
.IR @sysconfdir@/colorizerc ", " $HOME/.colorizerc
.RS
These files are the default configuration files for \fBcolorize\fR,
and are parsed by \fBccze\fR for the sake of full compatibility.
.RE
.IR @sysconfdir@/cczerc ", " $HOME/.cczerc
.RS
This two are the main configuration files, in which one can change the
colors used by the program to his liking. See the comments in the
beginning of \fI@sysconfdir@/cczerc\fR for a description on the files'
structure.
