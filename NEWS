NEWS -- list of user-visible changes		-*- outline -*-

* CCZE 0.1.80 [The Stance of Evander Sinque] -- 2002.10.12.

This is mainly a minor convenience-enhanced release. The major change
is that CCZE will now exit if it could not load any plugins.

* CCZE 0.1.72 [Base Level Erotica] -- 2002.10.04.

Brown paper-bag release, as I broke all the modules in 0.1.64. Apart
from this fix, this release is the same as 0.1.70 yesterday.

* CCZE 0.1.70 [Edenbeast] -- 2002.10.03.

Initial public release.
